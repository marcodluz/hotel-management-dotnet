- [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marcodluz/hotel-management-dotnet.git

   cd hotel-management-dotnet
   ```

2. Run the setup script to prepare the application:

   ```

## Usage

Once the build is complete, you can run the application with the following command:

cd HotelManagement.ConsoleApp

dotnet run --hotels hotels.json --bookings bookings.json
```

### Options

- `--hotels`: Specifies the path to the JSON file containing hotel data located in the root.
- `--bookings`: Specifies the path to the JSON file containing booking data located in the root.

### Commands

#### Availability Command

The `Availability` command retrieves the availability count for a specified room type and date or date range.

##### Input format:

```bash
Availability(HOTEL_CODE, DATE, ROOM_TYPE)
Availability(HOTEL_CODE, START_DATE-END_DATE, ROOM_TYPE)
```

- `HOTEL_CODE`: The unique code for the hotel (e.g., `H1`).
- `DATE`: A specific date in `YYYYMMDD` format.
- `START_DATE-END_DATE`: A range of dates in `YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD` format.
- `ROOM_TYPE`: The type of room (e.g., `SGL` for Single, `DBL` for Double).

##### Example Input:

```bash
Availability(H1, 20240901, SGL)
Availability(H1, 20240901-20240903, DBL)
```

##### Example Output:

```
2
1
```

**Note:** Hotels sometimes allow overbookings, so the availability count can be negative.

#### Availability Command

The `RoomTypes` command retrieves the available room types and their counts for a specified number of bookings on a given date or date range.

##### Input format:

```bash
RoomTypes(HOTEL_CODE, DATE, BOOKING_COUNT)
RoomTypes(HOTEL_CODE, START_DATE-END_DATE, BOOKING_COUNT)
```

- `HOTEL_CODE`: The unique code for the hotel (e.g., `H1`).
- `DATE`: A specific date in `YYYYMMDD` format.
- `START_DATE-END_DATE`: A range of dates in `YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD` format.
- `BOOKING_COUNT`: The number of bookings to check for room type availability.

##### Example Input:

```bash
RoomTypes(H1, 20240904, 3)
RoomTypes(H1, 20240905-20240907, 5)
```

##### Example Output:

```
DBL, DBL!
DBL, DBL, SGL
```

**Note:** If a room is partially filled, the room should be marked with a `!` and show an error if the allocation is not possible.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure .NET is correctly installed.
2. Verify that the `dotnet build` completed successfully.
3. Check the paths provided for the `--hotels` and `--bookings` options.
