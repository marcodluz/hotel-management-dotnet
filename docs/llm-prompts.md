1. I need to count how many rooms in the `hotels` exists for each room type, and then check in `bookings` how many are there, and then calculate the available rooms. Create a variable that outputs the `availableRooms` in my `AllocateRooms`.

2. Convert my `HandleHelp` from React to .NET, keep the same structure and output. (Pasted the React code)

3. Can you improve my command args parsing? I want to start form `'('` and end from `')'`. (Pasted the current `ParseCommandArguments` basic implementation)

4. Can you improve my `ParseDateRange` structure, keep the dataRanges and single data like I currently have. Keep the return of type `List<DateTime>`. (Pasted the current `ParseDateRange` basic implementation)
